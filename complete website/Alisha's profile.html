			<center><u><h2>About Me</h2></u></center>
			<center><p>I am Alisha Pitt, a young woman with a passion for many things. I love to dance and I am often found practicing in my living room or attending dance classes at my local studio. My favorite type of music is hip hop, which inspires me to move in ways that I never thought possible. When I'm not dancing, I can usually be found in the kitchen, cooking up a storm. I love to experiment with different flavors and ingredients and I am always looking for new recipes to try. And when I'm not dancing or cooking, I can be found curled up with a good book, lost in the pages of a thrilling novel or a thought-provoking work of non-fiction.</p></center>

			<center><u><h2>My passion</h2></u></center>
			<center><p>But despite my love for these hobbies, I have another passion that I am even more serious about: computers. From a young age, I have been fascinated by technology and the way that it can be used to solve problems and make people's lives easier. I spend hours tinkering with my computer, learning how to code and build websites from scratch. As I get older, my interest in computers only grows, and I begin to explore different areas of computer science, from artificial intelligence to data analysis.It is this last area that really captures my imagination. I am fascinated by the idea of using data to uncover hidden patterns and insights, and I know that I want to pursue a career in data analysis. So I set my sights on becoming a data analyst and begin to take classes and attend workshops to develop my skills.</p></center>

			<center><u><h2>My journey</h2></u></center>
			<center><p>My journey  is not an easy one. I face many obstacles along the way, from difficult coursework to the challenges of breaking into a male-dominated field. But I am determined to succeed, and I pour all of my energy into my studies and my work. I spend countless hours poring over datasets, looking for trends and patterns that others might have missed. And I always approach my work with the same level of dedication and rigor that I apply to my hobbies.</p></center>

			<center><p>Despite the challenges that I face, I am confident that I will be able to achieve my goals. I am passionate I know. And as I continue to work towards my goals, I find that my love for my hobbies is just as important as ever. They help me to stay balanced and focused, and they remind me of the importance of creativity and joy in all aspects of life.
