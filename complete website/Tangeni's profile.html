			<center><u><h2>My interest</h2></u></center>
			<center><p>Like I said in my intro . I always had a passion for computers and tech. i remember getting my first computer in 2014 and that’s when I discovered I wanted to work with them forever. In terms of tech I am interested in the field of software Engineering . computers run our world and more fields will be dominated by computers and AI in the near future so having a deep understanding of how software works means having a deep understanding how the world  works. </p></center>
